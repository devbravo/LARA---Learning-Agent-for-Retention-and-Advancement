# LARA — CLAUDE.md

Personal Learning Assistant for Diego Sabajo. Tracks study topics via SM-2
spaced repetition, sends proactive daily plans via Telegram, reads Google
Calendar to plan around real schedule, generates study briefs via Claude API,
books [Mock] events on Google Calendar after user confirmation, and 
creates or rebooks [Study] events for the in-progress study flow.

**Stack:** Python 3.11+, LangGraph, FastAPI, APScheduler, SQLite, Telegram Bot API

## LangGraph nodes

| Node | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `router` | Entry point. Reads checkpointed state. Routes by trigger. |
| `daily_planning` | Assembles morning plan from calendar + SM-2 + gap finder. Sets proposed_slots. |
| `on_demand` | Handles `/study` flow. Picks highest-priority due topic. |
| `done_parser` | Finds first unlogged slot from proposed_slots. Sends rating buttons. |
| `log_session` | Logs session row with quality score. Prompts for weak areas. |
| `log_weak_areas` | Saves weak areas (or clears on Skip). Prompts for next unlogged slot or ends. |
| `calendar_reader` | Read-only GCal fetch. |
| `sm2_engine` | Returns due topics ranked by tier + easiness factor. Pure Python. |
| `gap_finder` | Computes free windows respecting protected blocks. Pure Python. |
| `generate_brief` | Calls Claude API. Only node that uses an LLM. |
| `confirm` | Sends plan to Telegram. Awaits button tap. |
| `output` | Final Telegram send + GCal write after confirmation. |

## Triggers

| Trigger | What it starts |
|---|---|
| APScheduler daily | `daily_planning` → `confirm` → `output` |
| APScheduler Sunday | Weekly planning variant of `daily_planning` |
| APScheduler evening | `daily_planning` (tomorrow preview) → `output` |
| `/study` | `on_demand` → `generate_brief` → `confirm` |
| Duration tap (`30/45/60 min`) | `on_demand` → `generate_brief` → `confirm` |
| `confirm` tap | `output` → writes GCal events |
| `/done` | `done_parser` → END (waits for rating tap) |
| Rating tap (😕 😐 😊) | `log_session` → `output` → END (waits for weak areas reply) |
| Weak areas reply or Skip | `log_weak_areas` → `output` → END |
| `/briefing` | `daily_planning` (manual trigger for testing) |
| `/studied` | Webhook helper sends in-progress topic picker (inline buttons) |
| `studied:<topic_id>` tap | Promotes topic to `active`, resets SM-2 fields, sets first review for tomorrow |

## Graph flow

```
START → router → daily_planning → confirm → END
                               └→ output → END (no plan)

               → daily_planning (evening trigger) → output → END (preview only)

               → on_demand → generate_brief → confirm → END

               → done_parser → END (sends rating buttons, waits)

               → log_session → output → END (sends weak areas prompt, waits)

               → log_weak_areas → output → END
```

## Done flow — session logging

Triggered by `/done`. No structured paste required.

1. `/done` → `done_parser` finds first unlogged slot from `proposed_slots`
2. Sends rating buttons: "How did {topic} go?" `[😕 Hard] [😐 OK] [😊 Easy]`
3. Rating tap → `log_session` logs session row, updates SM-2, sends weak areas prompt
4. Text reply → saved to `sessions.weak_areas` + overwrites `topics.weak_areas`
5. Skip tap → clears `topics.weak_areas` to NULL (historical record in sessions preserved)
6. If more unlogged slots → repeat from step 2 for next topic
7. All logged → "All sessions logged for today. Great work! 💪"

| Button | Score | SM-2 effect |
|---|---|---|
| 😕 Hard | 2 | Below threshold — interval resets |
| 😐 OK | 3 | Passes — modest growth |
| 😊 Easy | 5 | Confident recall — fast growth |

**Weak areas design:**
- `topics.weak_areas` = operational field, drives brief generation context
- `sessions.weak_areas` = immutable historical record per session (future dashboard)
- Cleared on Skip = "no unresolved weak areas for next brief"
- Overwritten on new text = fresh unresolved issues

## Calendar safety rule — CRITICAL

Never modify a Google Calendar event unless `creator.self == True`.
The agent reads all events to plan around them but only writes events it created.
All agent-created events are prefixed `[Mock]`.

Enforce this in the calendar write path (tool/integration boundary):
```python
if not event.get("creator", {}).get("self", False):
    raise PermissionError("Cannot modify event not created by this agent")
```

## Telegram UX

**Morning briefing:**
```
☀️ Good morning Diego — <Day> <Date>

📅 Your day:
  <time> Event name (duration)

🧠 Today's mock interview(s) plan:
  <time>–<time> [Mock] <topic> (<duration>min)

Confirm these mock interview blocks?
[Yes, book them] [Skip]
```

**On-demand study:** `/study` triggers a default on-demand brief (currently 30min unless a duration is provided via callback).

**Done flow:** `/done` → rating buttons → weak areas prompt → next topic or done

**Never message during:** protected block defined in `config.yaml` (current default in repo: `15:00-19:00`).

## Development principles

- POC first — minimum features that solve the real problem
- No LLM where a formula works — SM-2 and gap_finder are pure Python
- Claude API only inside `generate_brief` — no other node calls the LLM
- Calendar safety rule is non-negotiable — enforce it in calendar write boundaries
- Prefer `get_connection()` from `src.core.db` for SQLite access (legacy direct connections may still exist)
- Error handling required in all nodes — catch exceptions, return user-friendly messages
- Never overwrite checkpointed state with None — only pass kwargs that are explicitly provided

## Security

- `.env` is never committed
- `credentials/` is never committed
- Validate `X-Telegram-Bot-Api-Secret-Token` header on every webhook request
- SQLite files are local only — never exposed via HTTP
